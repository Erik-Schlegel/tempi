- Raspberry Pi 5
  - 27+W power supply
  - Installation media (usb or micro sd)
  - [Recommended Kit](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Starter-Kit-PRO/dp/B0CRSNCJ6Y)

- Note: this setup will run on lower spec Pi devices and power supplies, but the RTL-SDR has a draws more power than a typical usb, so it's good to have some headroom.
